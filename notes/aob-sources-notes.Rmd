# [@Hoefel_2005] 

This study was located in Australia. They used MPN assay and qPCR to measure both total bacteria and AOB in the WTP and in the drinking water system. They did not inspect or sample biofilms in this study. 

This study will likely be helpful when looking at methods used to analyze AOB in samples

Primers used:

  * Universal 16S by PCR -  **27F-1492R** primer set used for first run followed by nested amplification with **357F-GC–518R**
  * AOB specific - 30 cycles using **CTO** primer set was used for the first round. The products of this first round of sampling were used as the template for the nested PCR, which were performed using the **357F-GC–518R** primer set. 
  * NOB specific - **EUB338f-NIT3** was used to detect *Nitrobacter* and **EUB338f-Ntspa0685M** was used to detect *Nitrospira*
  * qPCR - For universal assay, DNA was extracted from a known amount of PCR products previously amplified using the **27F-1492R** primer. For AOB assay, DNA was extracted from known quantities of PCR products amplified from Nitrosospira multiformis ATCC 25196, using the **amoA1F-amoA2R** primer set.
  

Results: 

  * They found that AOB had an average concentraion of 3.14e4 +/- 1.47e2 copies/ml and that made up ~5.6% of the bacterial community. 
  * Looking at the number of active microbes in the system they found the concentration on average to be 3.43e3 copies/ml
